# Examples

This folder contains example scripts demonstrating how to use SIBERIA for time series analysis.

## Getting Started

Before running the examples, make sure you have SIBERIA installed:

```bash
pip install siberia
```

## Available Examples

Examples will be added here to demonstrate:
- Computing signatures from time series data
- Fitting null models (binary Signed Random Graph Model - bSRGM, binary Signed Configuration Model - bSCM)
- Validating signatures with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction
- Building and filtering signed graphs
- Community detection
- Visualization of results
